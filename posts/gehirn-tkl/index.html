<p>The Gehirn marks Baionlenja's return to the customs scene. After being scammed by his manufacturer on the GB of the Bias R2, many thought he would never return. Despite explaining his situation to his Discord members, many remained skeptical and believed he intended to make an exit scam.</p>
<p>In recent times, a multitude of exit scams have plagued the hobby, leaving many in a state of disbelief and distrust towards new and even existing vendors. If you want to learn more about the current exit scam situation, consider watching this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fdSJgInpsg">Taehatypes</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding Baion, Manu, one of the most well-known vendor managers, has taken him under his wing to guide him out of debt. The Gehirn marks the beginning of Baion's redemption, as some might say. According to Manu, his plan is to create new projects that won't be run by Baionlenja directly but will be managed by vendors instead. This is to ensure that people won't feel like they're being scammed again.</p>

<p>Now, let's discuss the design of the board. The Gehirn is a classic F12 top mount board that draws inspiration from HR Giger and Y2K aesthetics.</p>
<p>The most striking feature of the board has to be its weight, which showcases an extremely detailed engraving of a fossilized alien. Additionally, the board features intricate engravings on the top, inside, and backside.</p>
<p>The Gehirn board also boasts Baion's unique &quot;screw-less&quot; design, the Baion bolts.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional screw-less boards that have holes on the top and bottom of the PCB and plate for screwing the case together, Baionbolts enable you to screw the case at a 45-degree angle back together. This design not only allows for the use of larger screws but also reduces the risk of losing screws inside the case.</p>
<p>Many people appreciate this feature as it eliminates the need to open up the entire case just to retrieve a lost screw.</p>

<p>The keyboard hobby has been shifting towards in-stock sales, and the Gehirn follows this trend. It will have two rounds, each with its own unique colors. This means that you will only have the opportunity to purchase the specific colors you want during each round.</p>
<p>Round 1 offered a total of 200 units, all of which were WKL (Win Key Less) layouts. Vendors in eight different regions carried the board, and it was already produced before the preorder was opened for 24 hours.</p>
<p>On May 15, R2 will be released with 335 units available. Baion and Manu have added two more vendors for this round and will offer WK (Win Key), HHKB (Happy Hacking Keyboard), and WKL (Win Key Less) layouts.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Gehirn will feature two collaborations: one with GMK Symbiote and another with their upcoming project, GMK Nerve.</p>
<p>Both R1 participants and future R2 joiners can look forward to a board that caters to a popular niche.</p>
