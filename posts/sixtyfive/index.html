<p>Mode Designs is a well-known name in the keyboard hobby. They have been making a name for themselves over the past few years.</p>
<p>In 2020, they released their first keyboard the Mode Eighty, which was updated in 2022 with some internal improvements.</p>
<p>In 2021, they released the original SixtyFive, which was well received for its bold design and generous amounts of customization. After three years, the company decided to revisit the feedback they had received on the original keyboard. As Mode states, this project has been a labor of love for them, showcasing their passion for keyboards and their own designs. The new SixtyFive returns with an updated design while staying true to its roots.</p>

<p>After the SixtyFive came the Sonnet, which is Mode Designs most well-known design to date. Like the SixtyFive, the Sonnet had an accent bar at the top. However, the Sonnet also marked the start of Mode Designs modern design language. While both boards had similar aesthetics, the Sonnet established certain design aspects that would be seen again in the future</p>
<p>Mode partnered with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mod.musings/">Mod Musings</a> to create stunning oak accents for the Sonnet. This collaboration marked the beginning of Mode's journey to design more beautiful wooden accents for their future boards.</p>
<p>But what sets Mode Designs apart from others? They were one of the first vendors to create a full in-stock experience for buyers. When Mode released a board, they would typically have a pre-order window, allowing all who want the keyboard to get it in the configuration they want.</p>
<p>This brings us to another specialty of Mode: their configurator, which was first released in 2021 with the original SixtyFive. Many of us have seen at least one configurator in our lives, whether it's when buying an iPhone or trying to buy a laptop that won't break the bank and will still last for the next five years.</p>
<p>After the pre-order window, Mode tries to keep a certain amount of parts in stock and regularly restocks these parts. This allows hobbyists to get replacements or try a different plate material if they want.</p>

<p>Corporate design is a term that many of us have heard of, especially if we've worked near the UI/UX team at our workplace. It's similar to a brand identity and dictates many design aspects of a business, from the fonts used to all of the colors. This applies not only to what clients see but also to internal workings, such as documents and presentations.</p>
<p>Following this, we can see how Mode has implemented this concept into all of their boards since the Sonnet, including the Envoy (a cheaper, one-part case design), the Tempo (a HHKB-style keyboard), and the Loop (a TKL). All of these boards have one thing in common: their accent bar. This makes Mode boards easily recognizable from far and up close. </p>

<p>Now, let's talk about the New SixtyFive. It combines the aesthetics of the old SixtyFive with modern internals and a preference for new colors and materials. The board boasts the same mounting system that was introduced in the Envoy: lattice mounts. They are a type of gasket mount that allows for different typing feelings and also works for creating an isolated topmount.</p>

<p class="image-text">Photo by <a href="https://modedesigns.com/pages/sixtyfive">Mode Designs</a></p>
<p>On the bottom of the board is where the &quot;biggest&quot; change was made. The original board did not have any weights or engraving in it, while the new SixtyFive has added a small ring on the bottom for nicer aesthetics and a contribution to the keyboard's haptics. The circle in the middle acts as a badge that is held in with magnets, meaning you can easily change it out for another color or material for a two-tone design on the bottom.</p>
<p>The SixtyFive will start at a base price of $249 and can go up to $614. The pre-order has already started as of April 17, and fulfillment will begin in May of this year.</p>
<p>I think that Mode has done a fabulous job with the new SixtyFive, allowing for a lot of customization while also maintaining a simple and beautiful design.</p>
